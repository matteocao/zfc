    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is it so important to give an axomatic definition of set theory? Well, a very naif answer is to give enough rules to teach a computer how to dal with sets! And if a computer can deal with sets, it can also deal with numbers! And from numbers, most of mathematics can be implemented on a computer. And here I am not just referring to numerical mathemtics:mI really mean alsmost all other fields, liike algebra and topology!\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, you can argue that dealing with infinty may be a bit tricky: let's see what we can do!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scope\n",
    "\n",
    "In this short notebook we show how it is possible to build abstract set theory ona a computer using the ZFC axioms.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is that the axioms should a compelte set of rules to havea computer understand and operate with abstacts sets -- defined as objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will also be able to remove some of these axioms and see what the consequences are."

    "## The definition of a set\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, it's really not easy to define a set without incurring into recursing definitioons: on the dicitonary wou will probably find something like \"a collection of element\". Sure, but what is a collection?\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, here we will approach sets in a dfferent way: **sets are rigid rooted trees**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Subdefintions\n",
    "\n",
    " - **tree**: a connectd graph with no cycles\n",
    " - **rooted**: a rooted tree is a tree with a designated vertex called root\n",
    " - **rigid**: a tree is said to be rigid if it has a trivial automorphism group\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "A rigid tree:\n",
    "\n",
    "![rig](./rigid.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "A non rigid tree, as there is a non-trivial automorphism that permutes $(g, h, i)$\n",
    "\n",
    "![non_rig](./non_rigid.png)\n",

    "Let's define the `class` set to be based on these statements"

    "## Building everything from the empty set: Separation and Replacement axioms\n",
    "\n",
    "The empty set in our current defintion is `[]`. It is more of a placeholder than anything else. The empty set correspond to the **leaf nodes** of the rooted graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we are assuming its exstence: this is an axiom then! In the Zermelo-Fraenkel list of axioms there is actually not an \"empty set axiom\", but rather there are two, the **Separation and Replacement axioms**. Given $\\phi$ a rule (i.e. an expression of first order logic composed by the basic logical operations), the two axioms state that:\n",
    " - $\\exists x\\in a, \\phi(x)$, where $a$ is a set, $\\phi(x)$ is a set as well (separation)\n",
    " - $\\phi(a)$ is a set (replacement)\n",
    "\n",
    "For non-empty sets, the separation axiom is equivalent to the replacement axiom. Hence, the separation axiom is equivalent to the existence of the empty set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, the set containing the empty set is `Set([])` and this corresponds to a rooted graph with one edge and 2 vertices (one of which is the root).\n",
    "Out of this basic constructions we can build more elaborate sets:"

    "## Axiom of choice\n",
    "\n",
    "We come now to the most controversial axiom of all set theory: **the axiom of choice**.\n",
    "\n",
    "It short, it states that, given a list of non-empty subsets of a set, it is always possible to pick one element for each subset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The big question (and the controversy) is: how do we pick the element!? In case of the existence of an ordering for xample, once can simply define the representative element by choosing the smallest (or largest) element in the subset -- hence no need for the axiom of choice. But in the more general case?\n",
    "\n",
    "In python we clearly see how important this axiom is, as we would really like to write a `element` method that returns a single element... but indeed, how do we pick it?"
